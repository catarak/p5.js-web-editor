# Contributing to the p5.js web editor

We welcome community contributions to the p5.js web editor! You can contribute even if you are not a developer by documenting bugs, proposing new features, and updating documentation.

When opening an issue, be sure to clearly describe the issue, task, or feature. If it is a bug, try to include steps to reproduce or other contextual information, such as the browser or operating system. 

Feel free to work on any open issue, though make sure you reply that you are working on it. first-timers-only and help-wanted tagged issues are coming soon :smile:

To begin development follow the steps in [README.md](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor#development-installation) to install the project locally.
