I have verified that the pull request:

* [ ] has no linting errors -- `npm run lint`
* [ ] is from a uniquely-named feature branch and has been rebased on top of the latest master. (If you're asked to make more changes, make sure you rebase onto master then too!)
* [ ] is descriptively named and links to an issue number, i.e. `Fixes #123`
