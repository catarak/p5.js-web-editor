# [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

The p5.js Web Editor is an in-browser editor for creating and sharing [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches. It is designed in the same spirit as p5.js, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. Users don't need to download or configure any software to start creating, they can simply open the website, and immediately start a sketch. Users can also host their work online and look at the work of others. 

The p5.js Web Editor is currently in active development, and looking for contributions of any type!
