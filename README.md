# [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

The p5.js Web Editor is an in-browser code editor for creating [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) sketches. p5.js, which is a separate project, is a JavaScript library with the goal of making coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and the web editor shares this same spirit. It is designed with the benginner in mindâ€”when using the web editor, you don't need to download or configure anything, you can simply open the website, and start writing code. You can also host their work online and share it with others.
